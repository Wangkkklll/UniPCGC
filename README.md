## üìå Introduction

We propose an efficient unified point cloud geometry compression framework UniPCGC. It is a lightweight framework that supports lossy compression, lossless compression, variable rate and variable complexity. First, we introduce the Uneven 8-Stage Lossless Coder (UELC) in the lossless mode, which allocates more computational complexity to groups with higher coding difficulty, and merges groups with lower coding difficulty. Second, Variable Rate and Complexity Module (VRCM) is achieved in the lossy mode through joint adoption of a rate modulation module and dynamic sparse convolution. Finally, through the dynamic combination of UELC and VRCM, we achieve lossy compression, lossless compression, variable rate and complexity within a unified framework. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, our method achieves a compression ratio (CR) gain of 8.1\% on lossless compression, and a Bjontegaard Delta Rate (BD-Rate) gain of 14.02\% on lossy compression, while also supporting variable rate and variable complexity.

## üîë Setup
Our cuda version is 11.6. We recommend using the following command to complete the installation.
```
conda create -n unipcgc python=3.8
conda activate unipcgc
pip install -r requirements
```
After completing the above installation, you should also install MinkowskiEngine. For the installation of [MinkowskiEngine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine), see the official repository. 

Warn!!! The following yml environment is in the development version environment, which introduces many irrelevant libraries and is not recommended.
Type the command for general installation
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
